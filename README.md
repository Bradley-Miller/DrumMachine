# DrumMachineD
This project was originally a CMPS 401 project that after the class ended, I decided to expand and edit to improve upon it and as a fun hobby.
Originally called "DDrums", I decided to go for a less copyright-infringing name after I found out that ddrum is an actually company. 
DrumMachineD is a drum machine that is written in D, utilizing a D binding for the BASS audio library, gtk-D for widgits, and a timer library to provide a milisecond timer. It also uses the DUB package manager.
